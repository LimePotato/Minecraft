# SignBoard config.yml
# If auto update is active for SignBoard, the config.yml file will be automatically updated as well 
# When config.yml is updated, all changes you made to the VALUES of the settings will be PRESERVED and copied over to the new config.yml
# ... however, any changes you made to the COMMENTS in this file will be overwritten by the default comment.
# The original config.yml will be renamed config.bak
#-----:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Auto updates: 
# Possible values for updates: 
# auto  (downloads and installs new versions automatically); 
# check (only checks if a new version is available); 
# off   (turns off updates completely).
updates: auto

# Config.yml version - if this is lower than the actual SignBoard version (use /sb version), it means you probably should do a manual merge of config.new and config.yml.
# If updates=auto and this version is lower than the actual SignBoard version, it will trigger an automatic config.yml update on the next server restart.
version: 1.6.5

# Category separator - in board names, anything that appears after this character will be considered a category name
# If you change the category separator after having boards that use it, you will have to either delete those boards or manually edit their names in boards.yml so they use the new separator.
# If you choose to edit boards.yml, DO IT WITH EXTREME CARE and don't change ANYTHING other than the separator character, or your boards may stop working.

# Detect the presence of FeatherBoard and work around it by issuing /fb off and /fb on before boards are shown/hidden.
# If this is set to false, SignBoard will have problems with FeatherBoard and you must manage any conflicts yourself (maybe by using permissions).
# If this is set to true, SignBoard will work alongside FeatherBoard, but the transitions (showing/hiding boards) will be slower.

# Commands Before - these commands will be run right before showing a board to a player (every time).
# This feature was created to allow you to temporarily disable other plugins that interfere with SignBoard showing its boards.
# But it can be used to run any commands you like. All commands will be run as the player and as if the player were Op.
# Separate multiple commands with a |. Anything after a # will be ignored. Commands accept SignBoard variables.
# FEATHERBOARD users - see the featherboard_aware option in this config.yml
cmd_before: # tell {PName} about to say hey | tell {PName} hey

# Commands After - these commands will be run right after showing a board to a player (every time).
# This feature was created to allow you to re-enable other plugins that interfere with SignBoard showing its boards.
# But it can be used to run any commands you like. All commands will be run as the player and as if the player were Op.
# Separate multiple commands with a |. Anything after a # will be ignored. Commands accept SignBoard variables.

# View distance: 
# How close (in blocks) you have to be to a sign to activate its board 
# (remember that wall signs are actually located on the block they're facing).
view_distance: 5

# Entity view distance: 
# How close (in blocks) you have to be to a living entity to activate its board
# Remember: works best if you look the living entity in the face 
entity_view_distance: 8

# Entity view radius:
# Signboard determines if you're "looking" at a living entity by analyzing how closely you're looking at the entity's left eye.
# So there's a radius around the entity's left eye that's the threshold for saying that you're looking at it.
# This process is never very precise, but we can achieve a more "natural" hit/miss by using a slightly larger radius for small entities and a slightly smaller radius for larger entities
# The radius parameter can vary from 0.01 to 0.15
# Radius for small creatures: bat, chicken, endermite, magmacube, ocelot, pig, rabbit, silverfish, wolf
entity_small_viewradius: 0.10
# Radius for medium creatures: blaze, cavespider, creeper, guardian, NPCs, pigman, sheep, shulker, skeleton, slime, spider, villager, witch, zombie
entity_medium_viewradius: 0.06
# Radius for large creatures: cow, enderdragon, enderman, ghast, giant, horse, irongolem, mooshroom, polarbear, snowman, squid, wither
entity_large_viewradius: 0.02

# Reserved words:
# SignBoard will not allow the following words to be used for board names
# ...instead, it will tell the user the name is already taken.
# This is not meant to be a bad word filter; please try to keep the list short.
# DO NOT change the format of these lines or use punctuation or special characters among the words.
# The words are not case sensitive.
reserved_names:
- boards board board1 board2 board3 board01 board02 board03 signs sign sign1 sign2 sign3 sign01 sign02 sign03
- one two three four five six seven eight nine ten

# Command aliases:
# SignBoard can respond to any of these five root commands: /sb /signboard /sbd /sbrd /signbd
# The active_aliases parameter controls which ones are actually used. 
# For example, the following configuration would make SignBoard accept all 5 root commands: active_aliases: sb signboard sbd sbrd signbd
# By default, only three options are active, but you can mix and match as needed to ensure compatibility with other plugins in your server.
# The first option on the list will be the one featured on all of SignBoard's help texts (usually "/sb").
# Don't try to add other aliases options; SignBoard only accepts these five.
active_aliases: sb sbd signboard

# Logging:
# Set to true to enable logging of SignBoard's startup process (only during server start). 
# The major steps that take place during startup are timed and written to log.yml. The log is cleared at each server restart.
