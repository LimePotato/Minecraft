# SignBoard version changes
history:
  '0_9':
  - Aug. 23, 2016
  - Initial release of SignBoard.
  '1_0':
  - Aug. 27, 2016
  - Improved performance.
  - Added auto updates.
  '1_0_1':
  - Aug. 29, 2016
  - Added check to limit board names to 15 char, to ensure they will fit on a sign.
  - When editing a board and simultaneously looking its sign, the text on the scoreboard
    will refresh automatically.
  '1_0_2':
  - Aug. 30, 2016
  - Fixed very minor bug in version 1.0.1 that made the plugin think it was still
    version 1.0, causing it to download a new update every time.
  '1_0_3':
  - Sep. 03, 2016
  - Added to config.yml a list of reserved names that cannot be used to create new
    boards. If you already have a board that uses one of these names, it will still
    work, the reserved names list only applies to new boards.
  - Added auto-update of the config.yml. When a new version of the plugin is installed,
    the config.yml will be automatically updated, preserving all of your settings
    (but not preserving any changes you might have made to the comments).
  '1_0_4':
  - Sep. 11, 2016
  - Added permissions.
  - Changed the help command so it would run from the console.
  '1_1_0':
  - Sep. 22, 2016
  - Implemented the attach and detach commands to allow boards to be attached to any
    sign without using [boardname] on the first line.
  - Fixed a bug where a board could be renamed to a reserved word.
  - OPs can now change lines on any sign, even if it belongs to someone else.
  - OPs can now list signs belonging to other players, with the command /sb board
    list all.
  - OPs can now rename and delete boards belonging to other players; SignBoard will
    warn them and ask them to repeat the command, just to be safe.
  - OPs now receive a one-time message when a new version is installed.
  - OPs can now check the changes implemented on any version, with the command /sb
    version <nbr>.
  '1_1_1':
  - Oct. 31, 2016
  - Rewrote the method for determining if a player is looking at a sign; it's much
    more robust and flexible. This fixes apparently random cases when SignBoard would
    not show a board even though the player was looking at the sign. Also allows players
    to look at signs from any angle.
  - Implemented '/sb entity' commands to allow attaching boards to living entities
    - animals, monsters, villagers, NPCs...
  - Upon start up, SignBoard now checks for "defunct" signs in signs.yml and attachments.yml
    and deletes them. If the server is run without loading SignBoard and any signs
    are deleted (broken in-game), they will no longer exist in the world, but will
    remain in signs.yml and attachments.yml. The new "cleanup" function during SignBoard
    startup takes care of that.
  - Made a number of small performance improvements in the code.
  '1_1_2':
  - Nov. 6, 2016
  - Fixed minor bug that allowed players to detach a board from an entity even if
    the board didn't belong to them.
  '1_1_3':
  - Nov. 8, 2016
  - Fixed small vulnerability to bugs in a CB method - player.getLineOfSight() - that
    could cause console IllegalStateException messages but really had no other consequences.
  - Included support for Spigot/CB versions 1.8.7 and above. Specifically tested with
    versions 1.8.7, 1.8.8, 1.9.0, 1.9.2, 1.9.4, 1.10.0, and 1.10.2.
  '1_1_4':
  - Nov. 11, 2016
  - Made a small improvement to the method that checks for version updates; now it
    will only download new versions that are numerically greater than the current
    version (before, it downloaded new versions if they were simply different from
    the current version). This shouldn't really make a difference to anyone, but it
    was bugging me :-).
  '1_1_5':
  - Nov. 30, 2016
  - Included support for Spigot/CB version 1.11. Versions specifically tested and
    approved now are 1.8.7, 1.8.8, 1.9.0, 1.9.2, 1.9.4, 1.10.0, 1.10.2 and 1.11.
  - Fixed a minor bug that crept up in some cases when a player placed or looked at
    a sign. An error message was shown on the console but there were no other consequences.
  - Switched from mcstats.metrics to mcstats.metricslite - should make no difference
    to anyone.
  '1_1_6':
  - Dec. 2, 2016
  - In commands, brackets around board names are now optional.
  - Included variables for use in board content.
  - New command '/sb variables' to list available variables and how to use them.
  '1_1_7':
  - Dec. 5, 2016
  - Minor adjustment in the startup console message for the auto-update function,
    which used to say "You can control this behavior in config.yml, by changing 'updates'
    to auto, check_only or dont_check", whereas the options in config.yml were auto,
    check and off. Everything still worked as expected regardless of which instruction
    was followed. Now all instructions say auto, check and off.
  - If updates is set to off in config.yml, the startup console message for auto-updates
    will no longer be shown.
  '1_1_8':
  - Dec. 5, 2016
  - Added support for Placeholder API
  '1_2_0':
  - Dec. 27, 2016
  - Restructured most of the plugin's code to better conform to OOP practices.
  - OPs can now attach signs to players.
  - Restricted renaming boards authorization to the board's owner or OPs only.
  - Restricted attaching/detaching boards authorization to the board's owner or OPs
    only.
  - Removed extraneous boards from the default boards.yml file.
  '1_2_1':
  - Jan. 12, 2017
  - The cleanup function no longer runs automatically - it was having problems with
    multiworld servers.
  - Made the cleanup function into an admin command - 'sb cleanup' - that also runs
    from the console.
  - The 'sb version' command is now available at the console.
  '1_2_2':
  - Jan. 30, 2017
  - Built-in compatibility with FeatherBoard; SignBoard now detects the presence of
    FB and issues 'fb off/on' commands before and after showing boards. This results
    in a seamless switch-over between SB and FB boards.
  - New 'cmdbefore' and 'cmdafter' options in config.yml to allow admins to turn off/on
    other plugins that may interfere with SignBoard.
  - Fixed minor bug that kept some of the new parameters from showing up in config.yml
    after an auto update.
  - The 'sb board list' command now shows, for each board, the number of attachments
    to signs or entities.
  '1_2_3':
  - Jan. 31, 2017
  - The 'sb board list' command now works from the console and displays results in
    alphabetical order (player names and board names).
  '1_2_4':
  - Feb. 2, 2017
  - Minor adjustment to 'sb board list' command to avoid errors in case owner ID in
    boards.yml is corrupted.
  - Restructured the help command.
  '1_2_5':
  - Feb. 12, 2017
  - New commands to control what happens when a player looks at a sign/entity, clicks
    a sign or attacks an entity. This includes the ability to control whether the
    board should be shown on screen or given as a book, and the ability to attach
    commands to be run at these times.
  '1_2_6':
  - Feb. 17, 2017
  - Rewrote the method for presenting the board texts as books; introduced use of
    \n for line breaks.
  - Players now don't receive multiple copies of the books.
  - Fixed a bug that was preventing the {PMoney} variable from displaying correctly.
    {Money} works as well.
  - The '/sb sign status' and '/sb entity status' commands now list the name of the
    attached board.
  '1_2_7':
  - Feb. 18, 2017
  - Fixed minor bug that prevented 'after' commands from running if two signs with
    boards were adjacent to each other.
  - Fixed minor bug that prevented a sign from being saved after receiving a new attachment
    if the player was looking at the sign from below at an angle.
  - Fixed minor bug that turned all commands attached to signs or entities into lowercase.
  - Adjusted {PMoney} variable to not display decimal places if they are zero.
  '1_2_8':
  - Feb. 21, 2017
  - Added config.yml option to disable the use of color on the console messages.
  - Added config.yml option to disable the one-time version update message shown to
    OPs in-game.
  '1_2_9':
  - Feb. 23, 2017
  - Fixed extraneous 'lf' symbols in the default 'new board'.
  - Improved how actions are saved in actions.yml; default actions do not need to
    be saved to file.
  '1_2_10':
  - Mar. 6, 2017
  - Config.yml option to disable color in console now applies to all console messages
    - except for (two) error messages and commands issued on the console by the user.
  '1_2_11':
  - Mar. 18, 2017
  - Added permissions for signboard.signcmds and signboard.entitycmds, to enable/disable
    use of before, after, onclick, onattack and onkill commands.
  - Fixed minor bug that allowed a player to specify before, after and onclick commands
    for a sign that didn't have a board attached (the commands would only run if a
    board was later attached to the sign, but still, allowing them to be specified
    was unintended behavior).
  - Changed message when player tries to specify commands for signs or entities that
    don't have a board attached.
  - Fixed bug that caused SignBoard not to recognize that some signs were created
    by a player after a server restart (message 'There's no record of you placing
    that sign'). Should be OK now.
  '1_2_12':
  - Mar. 25, 2017
  - Added permission for signboard.book, to control the user's ability to give out
    board texts as books.
  '1_2_13':
  - Mar. 28, 2017
  - The internal commands to deal with the presence of FeatherBoard (fb on/off) now
    are only triggered if the user actually had a non-SignBoard board showing that
    needed to be hidden/restored by SignBoard. This should improve FeatherBoard compatibility.
  '1_2_14':
  - Mar. 29, 2017
  - Fixed FeatherBoard bug introduced in version 1.2.13.
  - Added featherboard_aware option in config.yml. When set to TRUE, SignBoard will
    work fine alongside FeatherBoard, but transitions (showing/hiding boards) will
    be slower. When set to FALSE, transitions will be faster; SignBoard will ignore
    FeatherBoard and not work well with it (some people have worked around this with
    crafty use of permissions and '/fb off' and '/fb on').
  '1_2_15':
  - Apr. 10, 2017
  - Switched from MCStats to BStats for plugin statistics.
  '1_2_16':
  - May 14, 2017
  - Improved line breaking when writing board text to books.
  - Improved CB/Spigot version checking to allow for non-numeric version numbers (like
    "1.12-pre2").
  '1_2_17':
  - May 22, 2017
  - Added support for MVdW Placeholders.
  - Improved the message text for sign/entity action commands (status, give_book,
    show_board, run commands).
  - Fixed minor bug related to inserting new lines on a board in-game if the board
    had been shortened by altering boards.yml directly.
  - Added check to prevent inserting duplicate content on lines of a board, which
    is not supported.
  - PlaceholderAPI variables are now properly replaced in books as well.
  - Fixed bug in saving show_board and give_book options for signs.
  '1_2_18':
  - May 25, 2017
  - Fixed minor bug related to resetting action options when a board is detached from
    a sign.
  '1_2_19':
  - May 27, 2017
  - Tested under Spigot 1.12-pre5.
  - Added a more robust check for problems with PlaceholderAPI and MVdW API.
  - Added "sign owner" info to output of /sb sign status.
  '1_3_0':
  - Sep 17, 2017
  - Tested under Spigot 1.12.1.
  - Added a '/sb entity tagname' command with options to treat entity tagname visibility,
    specifically when showing attached boards. Options are 'ignore' (the default -
    keeps current tagname visibility), 'hide' and 'show'.
  '1_3_1':
  - Sep 19, 2017
  - Tested under Spigot 1.12.2.
  - Fixed minor nametag bug where if a board was deleted while attached to an entity,
    the delete process would not properly restore the nametag to its original state.
  - Added MCStats back now, in addition to BStats - seems like at least one of their
    sites is always having problems, I hope using both will give us more reliable
    plugin stats. There's no overhead or any kind of penalty for having both.
  '1_3_2':
  - Sep 25, 2017
  - Added the ability to create board 'sets', so that it's possible to attach several
    boards to a sign or entity and then cycle through them by right or left- clicking.
  - Added the '/sb set' command group, for creating and deleting board sets.
  '1_3_3':
  - Sep 27, 2017
  - Added the ability to insert delays in command sequences for signs and entities.
    A sequence of [5s] | <cmd1> | [2m] | <cmd2> will wait 5 seconds before running
    <cmd1> and then 2 minutes before running <cmd2>.
  '1_3_4':
  - Oct 2, 2017
  - Fixed a bug introduced in 1.3.2 that made SignBoard clash with Shopkeepers and
    make NPCs (with boards attached) vulnerable.
  - Fixed a bug that would remove attachments from a destroyed sign even if the sign's
    destruction was denied (and avoided), e.g. by Worldguard.
  '1_3_5':
  - Oct 5, 2017
  - Introduced a logging option for the the SignBoard startup process. This is disabled
    by default and controlled by the log_on option in config.yml. If you feel that
    SignBoard is taking too long to start up when you restart your server, first try
    the /sb cleanup command; if that doesn't help, turn on the log option and send
    me the contents of log.yml, please :-).
  '1_4_0':
  - Oct 26, 2017
  - Fixed minor bug in parsing the delays in command sequences for signs and entities.
  - Completely removed the signs.yml file, which was getting big on some servers.
    Its only purpose was to prevent players from using SignBoard commands on signs
    that were created by someone else...
  - '... But if the user can break the sign, it makes no difference who created it.
    So now SignBoard simply tests whether a player can break a sign; if yes, then
    he can use SignBoard commands on it.'
  - '... And there''s no longer any need for signs.yml.'
  '1_4_1':
  - Oct 27, 2017
  - Fixed bug in admin command /sb reload.
  - Made the loading of attachments and signs a little more robust.
  - Removed extraneous messages from the startup log (if active) about loading chunks.
  '1_4_2':
  - Oct 27, 2017
  - Fixed bug in the 'more robust' loading of attachments of 1.4.1.
  '1_4_4':
  - Nov 03, 2017
  - Improved loading of attachments and signs.
  - Fixed a bug from v1.4.1 that prevented SignBoard from loading signs on spawn chunks.
  - Servers with many SignBoard signs might notice a slightly faster startup.
  '1_4_5':
  - Nov 24, 2017
  - Included sign command options for shift-click, right-click and right-shift-click.
  - Changed the default permission for signcmds and entitycmds to false
  - Included aliases for the root SignBoard command. Now SignBoard accepts /sb /sbd
    /sbrd /signbd and /signboard.
  - Included config.yml option to ignore any of the aliases - if you have a different
    plugin that uses /sb, for instance, you can prevent SignBoard answering to that
    command.
  - Fixed very minor bug when a board named 'board' was used in /sb sign attach -
    now SignBoard gives a proper error message.
  '1_4_6':
  - Jan 20, 2018
  - Included a try-catch block to avoid (and log) a strange NPE that would creep up
    in certain situations when looking at signs.
  - Improved check for the presence of Vault and an Economy.
  - Prepared SignBoard to coexist with QueueMgr (coming soon, I hope :-).
  '1_4_7':
  - Jan 24, 2018
  - Fixed the Updater to work with the updated servermods api.
  '1_4_8':
  - Jan 27, 2018
  - Fixed a bug in permissions - for some commands (like entity attach), SignBoard
    was doing a hard isOP() check instead of also checking the admin permission. Now
    someone with signboard.admin permission will be treated just like an OP.
  '1_4_9':
  - Jan 29, 2018
  - Re-implemented FeatherBoard compatibility using the FB API (rather than fb commands)
  - Made it so players cannot trade with villagers the books they get from SignBoard
  - Fixed a bug when editing board lines to either blank or &r - inserting blank lines
    should be easier now
  '1_4_10':
  - Apr 14, 2018
  - Included a check in the updater for when the bukkit server is not available; should
    avoid error messages at server startup.
  '1_5_0':
  - Sep 3, 2018
  - Version 1.5.0 supports Bukkit/Spigot 1.13.1. Support for previous versions stopped
    1.4.10 but will return with 1.6.0.
  - Updated the list of "transparent" materials (things through which you can still
    "see" a SignBoard sign, such as an armor stand, or tall grass) to support 1.13
    materials.
  '1_6_0':
  - Aug 10, 2019
  - Version 1.6.0 now supports all versions of Bukkit/Spigot from 1.8.7 to 14.4.4.
    Also tested on Paper 1.14.4 (should work fine on any other version of Paper).
  - Rewrote the processing of "transparent" materials and made various other changes
    to allow support for new (and old) server versions with the same code.
  '1_6_1':
  - Apr 2, 2020
  - Version 1.6.1 was tested under Bukkit/Spigot 1.15.2 and should run fine in all
    previous versions since 1.8.7. Also tested on Paper 1.15.2 (should work fine on
    any other version of Paper).
  '1_6_2':
  - July 10, 2020
  - For the purposes of running commands when players click on signs, previously the
    clicks were ignored if the player was prevented (e.g. by another plugin) from
    doing damage to the sign. Now the clicks are processed and the commands will run.
  - Version 1.6.2 was tested under Bukkit/Spigot 1.16.1 and should run fine in all
    previous versions since 1.8.7. Also tested on Paper 1.16.1 (should work fine on
    any other version of Paper).
  '1_6_3':
  - August 25, 2020
  - Significantly improved sign detection when player looks at a sign; no more boundary
    issues with side-by-side signs or acute viewing angles.
  - Fixed a minor bug that effectively had the auto-updated disabled.
  - Due to these changes, version 1.6.3 no longer supports Bukkit/Spigot/Paper versions
    earlier than 13.3.
  '1_6_4':
  - August 29, 2020
  - Fixed bug where, if the /sb board copy command was used to create the copy of
    a sign, the two signs remained "linked" to each other until the plugin was reloaded
    (/sb reload) or the server restarted.
  '1_6_5':
  - September XX, 2020
  - Implemented categories.
