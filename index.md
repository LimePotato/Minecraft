## Server Backup and Issue Tracking

Welcome! We had a bunch of issues with backups lately so I decided to upload world files to a central repository,this way backups exist safely, and people can download the worlds when the server is offline, and ask to merge it with the main server files (acceptance will be a case by case process.)

this will also make it possible for people to request features, submit bug reports.

### "Whoah what is all this." I know. I know.

Here ill tell you how this whole thing works if you are new to Github.
